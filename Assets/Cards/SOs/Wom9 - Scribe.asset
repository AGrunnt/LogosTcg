    \u201CBeware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes~ and they
    love the greetings in the marketplaces~ the chief seats in the synagogues~ and
    the places of honor at banquets. They defraud widows of their houses~ and for
    a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.\u201D\u201D"

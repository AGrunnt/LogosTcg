    to fulfill the Scripture~ Jesus said~ \u201CI am thirsty.\u201D A jar of sour
    wine was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine~ put it on a stalk
    of hyssop~ and lifted it to His mouth. When Jesus had received the sour wine~
    He said~ \u201CIt is finished.\u201D And bowing His head~ He yielded up His spirit."

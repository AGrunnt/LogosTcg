  VerseText: "\u201CI am Gabriel~\u201D replied the angel. \u201CI stand in the presence
    of God~ and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
    And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day this comes to pass~
    because you did not believe my words~ which will be fulfilled at their proper
    time.\u201D"

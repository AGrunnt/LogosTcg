  VerseText: But it was not long before a cyclone called the Northeaster swept down
    across the island. Unable to head into the wind~ the ship was caught up. So we
    gave way and let ourselves be driven along. Passing to the lee of a small island
    called Cauda~ we barely managed to secure the lifeboat.

  VerseText: "\u201CAnd again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD~ They
    served the Baals~ the Ashtoreths~ the gods of Aram~ Sidon~ and Moab~ and the
    gods of the Ammonites and Philistines. Thus they forsook the LORD and did not
    serve Him. So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel~ and He sold them into
    the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites.\u201D"
